# raivBox

raivBox is a standalone digital neural audio synthesis device based on Google Magenta's DDSP library, with an NVIDIA Jetson Nano 2GB embedded prototyping system at its core. This entire project is designed to be as affordable and replicable as possible, while still offering a robust neural synthesis experience outside of a traditional laptop/desktop computer environment. raivBox is currently under development; this repository is not yet complete.
